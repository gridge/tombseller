 Following the yesterday discussion I would propose a big window with a smaller window inside. The smaller window will actually play the graphic adventure while in the external one (surrounding the inner-one) I would put everything is needed for the strategic part. In this way the user can play the adventure and wait for something to happen from the strategic point of view. We can also allow switching to a full-screen mode for the adventure or a full-strategic view.
